        Hello! I'm Taesung Yoon, a Boston University graduate with a B.A. in Computer Science.
        My passion lies at the intersection of UI/UX design and software engineering,
        where I craft user-centered solutions to create seamless digital experiences.
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy capturing moments through street photography and exploring creative ways to depict authenticity.
